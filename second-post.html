                <p style="color: black;">
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the first computer game was introduced in 1962, video games have had an ever expanding role and impact on society (Zackariasson 140). Although they were first introduced to demonstrate computer capabilities and not for the purpose of profit, entrepreneurs such as Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, saw the potential for making this new technology into a business (Zackariasson 140). 
				  With the rise of Atari, video games saw rapid growth in commerce which continues to this day (Zackariasson 140). In 2004, video games started earning more than Hollywood’s domestic boxoffices (Nichols 1). And video games are no longer just child's play as many may dismiss them. Polls show that 35% of American parents play video games (Toth). Increasingly video games have been incorporated into the medical field and have been the focus of political debates (Nichols 1). 
				  Video games are even being used to help teach Marine Corp recruits tactics and to educate U.S. Army recruits about Army life (Nichols 2). Video games are clearly on the rise. 
				  </p>
				  
				<p style="color: black;">
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the popularity of video games, new avenues of research have emerged. One new field of study is the economics of video games. 
				  Increasingly, this has meant examining the economic systems within video games (Nichols 38). In these economies
				  "individuals labour to produce goods which are then exchanged with the products of other peoples’ time" (Sousa 482).
				  Games which contain economic systems include, but are not limited to, EVE Online, Ultima Online, Everquest, Second Life, World of Warcraft and 
				  Runescape. Many of these games are classified under the label of Massively Multiplayer Online Games or MMO. MMOs are games which have persistent 
				  worlds which can be accessed from the internet (Zackariasson 146). This means that many people are experiencing the same world at the same time 
				  within the game. Zackariasson argues that these new waves of Massively Multiplayer Online Games are a paradigm shift in the video game industry and that 
				  "virtual worlds, both detention and extension worlds, will grow in number, size and complexity" (148).
				  Papagiannidis states that, when referring to MMOs, 
				  "we are probably on the verge of a development that is going to be as significant as the Internet itself" (616).
				  EVE Online is one game that has generated interest because of its extensive database of information (Casey) and the hands off approach the 
				  developers have taken on the game’s economy (Thorpe 3). EVE Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game which allows players to travel 
				  through a galaxy made of 7,500 star system (Fronda). Players are allowed to fight in wars, trade resources and create trade alliances (Fronda). 
				  Within this virtual world, researchers are finding new ways to study and solve recurring problems in the real world. 
				  "Creation and simulation in virtual worlds appear to offer the best domain to test the new ideas required to tackle the very 
				  real problems of deprivation, inequality, unemployment and poverty that exists in national economies" (Fronda).
				  After analysing the EVE Online databases one such study found that both female subscribers and female avatars controlled by male subscribers 
				  both had lower chances of success when compared to their male counterparts (Casey). 
				  Another study which took place in Runescape examined the endowment effect and the role experience in certain markets has on how much value we 
				  give to the goods which we own (Sousa). 
				  The increasing popularity of games containing virtual economies have lead to new debate and discussion. One point of conflict when it comes to 
				  virtual economies is whether or not these economies should be regulated as the line between what is virtual and what is real becomes less and less defined.
                </p>

				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of virtual currencies and virtual economies has followed the general pattern in the abstraction of money (Chambers 380). 
				The most basic form of trade is known as bartering where individuals trade certain goods for other desirable goods (Chambers 380). 
				As people realized that it would be more efficient to have a common commodity to trade with, there was a rise in currencies such as honey, rice, and grains (Chambers 380). 
				Later on, currencies changed from being consumables to being metals because of the durability of metals compared to consumables (Chambers 380). 
				This change caused currencies to become something more abstract (Chambers 380). An even larger abstraction came with the creation of paper currency which first represented metals and later had no metal backing at all (Chambers 380). 
				Chambers argues that because the economy can be better understood as a continuum ranging from the concrete to the abstract, the introduction of virtual currencies is just as real as the introduction of paper currencies (381). 
				Currencies in virtual economies are given value by those who use that currency because it allows them to purchase virtual commodities that they would not have been able to purchase otherwise. Just as real economies are subject to scandals and crises, so are virtual worlds.
				</p>
	
				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual economies have both benefits and detriments when it comes to security. One example of a security concern that exists in the real world but may not exist in a virtual world is the issue of violence to obtain another person’s belongings (Thorpe 3). 
				Some games simply do not allow players to steal from one another by killing them, (Thorpe 3) although real world violence can arise from virtual world disputes (Thorpe 4). Another security concern that is often eliminated is misrepresentation of a product. 
				It may be very difficult or impossible to misrepresent a product which is being sold in a virtual world (Thorpe 3). On the other hand, there have been scandals and crises in a virtual world which has been used as an argument for increasing legislation in virtual worlds. 
				One such example involves a bank which was created in the game Second Life known as Ginko Financial (Chambers 383). In Second Life, players are given no clear goals or achievements (Papagiannidis 611). Much of the content created in Second Life is created by the gamers and is protected by intellectual property rights put in place by the game developers (Chambers 378). 
				Players were also allowed to make their own banking institutions until the collapse of Ginko Financial. Ginko Financial was a large and popular investment bank in the world of Second Life which offered investors large returns (Chambers 383). 
				Eventually Linden Labs, the developers of Second Life, made changes to the gambling policy within the game and no longer allowed gambling (Chambers 383). 
				With the news of the changing gambling policies, there was a run on Ginko Financial which had many of its investments in gambling institutions. Ginko Financial was eventually forced to close and Linden Labs only allows chartered banks to become banks within the game world (Chambers 383). 
				Unlike other games with virtual economies, Second Life facilitates the exchange of virtual currency for real world dollars (Chambers 381). As quoted by Chambers, “If this is real money, there is an argument you need to follow real law” (383). The exchange of virtual currencies for real world currencies is not only isolated to Second Life. 
				Although it is not allowed by the developers, ISK, the currency of EVE Online, can be bought on eBay (Chambers 383). As stated by Papagiannidis, these worlds are not just gaming environments, but extensions of our physical universe,” (611).
				</p>

				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of crises that happen in the virtual world can be seen in EVE Online. In EVE Online one player created a bank which lent players money in exchange for their goods being pledged as collateral (Chambers 383). Eventually the bank had accumulated 8.9 trillion ISK in deposits (Chambers 383). 
				The CEO of the bank then sold the ISK for real world currency and made off with depositors investments (Chambers 383). Yet another example of how virtual and real worlds collide is seen in the game Legends of Mir 3 (Thorpe 4). One man lent another man a sword which was then sold without permission (Thorpe 4). 
				The man who lent the sword reported the theft to the police who said there was nothing they could do (Thorpe 4). The man who lent the sword chose to take matters into his own hands and stabbed and killed the man to whom he had lent the sword (Thorpe 4). As incidents such as these continue to occur the question over who has the authority to regulate these economies continues to be asked and debated.
				</p>

				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As virtual economies become larger and gain more and more popularity, it is important to ask who has authority over these economies. Usually this has been an easy answer stating that the creators of the game have the power to change the way the game is played (Chambers 378). 
				This view has been challenged in recent years. One argument for introducing legislation into virtual worlds has been stated in this paper. That argument states that because the economy can be seen as a continuum from the concrete to the abstract with virtual economies closer to abstract, these economies are just as susceptible to real world policy as the real world is (Chambers 384). 
				This argument views virtual world commodities as being just as valued as real world commodities and therefore should be protected just as real world commodities are. Another argument for legislation in virtual worlds states that “If economic activities migrates into virtual economies, where there are no earth jurisdictions, there will be a net loss of taxable assets and incomes in Earth’s economies” (Chambers 382). 
				Although these arguments are interesting, one major point brought up by Thorpe is the aspect of choice allowed in virtual economies as opposed to real world economies (2). 
				</p>

				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike real world economies which people are unable to opt-out of, virtual economies are entirely optional (Thorpe 2). People are free to participate in virtual economies in any way and to any extent they desire (Thorpe 2). Another argument against legislation in virtual worlds is the introduction of large scale experimentation in a shorter amount of time (Thorpe 5). 
				Virtual economies allow us to analyse large amounts of data with ease in a way that is not possible in the real world. This introduces an interesting possibility to test almost exactly the same world twice and simultaneously to determine which world people would prefer and analyse coinciding legislative measures in that world. Yet another question which needs to be answered is the question of accountability in a virtual world. 
				If the avatar in the game being played is a virtual representation of a physical person, should that virtual avatar be considered a physical actor (Papagiannidis 614)? Furthermore the question over who actually makes decisions in a virtual world, the avatar or the person controlling it, should be answered as well (Papagiannidis 620). Questions concerning control of legislation in a virtual world have also risen (Thorpe 4).  
				Unlike the real world, video games have no borders which makes them difficult to regulate when it comes to virtual economies. Chambers mentions this when saying that “The legal jurisdiction of virtual worlds is a discussion for another paper” and continues by giving a few options for how jurisdiction should be determined including location of game servers and new international laws (379-380). 
				</p>

				
				<p style="color: black;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, virtual economies are on the rise and with them come unprecedented opportunities to analyse human action in a way which is much more efficient than analysing real worlds. As studies such as that of  Sousa continue to emerge, the usefulness of these new methods have begun to show. 
				Unlike the real world, virtual economies give an option as to whether to participate in them or not and although legislation in video games could be considered as an option to protect against crises and scandals, implementation of legislation leave many questions regarding enforcement, authority and culpability unanswered.
