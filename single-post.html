            Virtual economies have undeniably risen in popularity as more and more people take part in virtual worlds. As Castranova points out, “The number of people engaged in virtual economic activity is also rising at a substantial clip, with industry research suggesting that in 2011, 170 million people spent some time playing in persistent or semi-persistent virtual worlds in the US and the UK alone.” (788, Policy Questions) With this increase in the popularity and scope of virtual economies, new avenues for research and analysis have emerged and have given real world economists another realm in which to apply principles of economics (Haruvy), however the comparisons with the real world do not stop at economic comparisons. Behavioral comparisons of how people (Sousa) and corporations (Spaulding) act and how they succeed in the real and virtual world have also been drawn. Scholars including Castronova and Chambers have also pointed out how real world governments could have a role in regulating virtual world economies as they may be more real than they appear at first glance. Macroeconomic principles have also been analysed in both the real world and virtual world to see how they compare. (Castronova, As Real as Real?) There are endless ways in which to compare real world economies with virtual world economies. This paper will aim to identify some of the main differences and similarities that have been found when comparing real and virtual economies.

                  <p style="color: black;">
            Before continuing a paper such as this we must recognize, as other scholars have endlessly pointed out when dealing with this subject, that the word “virtual economy” to name what is being described does not fit as well as it may seem at first glance. The labeling of these economies as virtual economies seems to have been “a labeling misstep.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 787) Chambers states that “that the virtual world created is not actually virtual, but a continuum of the real world, but placed in a virtual platform.” (379) Castranova also makes a very important point when stating that “The ‘real’ economy deals with things that are intangible all the time, as people buy, sell, and trade URLs, images, software, and ideas without second thought to the reality of the product. The items in a virtual world are not different. They are intangible, but they are also useful, scarce, and persistent.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 787) Despite being similar in many ways, virtual economies and real world economies do have significant differences which will be discussed later on.

    				<p style="color: black;">
            One of the largest and most obvious differences from virtual economies to real economies is the power that people could potentially have to manipulate the economies and worlds in which they exist. Virtual worlds can be changed completely and readily from what they may have been previously. “The rules (physical, social, or laws) of a virtual world can be defined more extensively and easily than the rules of the real world.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 787) As opposed to changes made to laws in real worlds, virtual worlds have the ability to change not only laws affecting legality, but also laws affecting physics, and science. (Castronova, Policy Questions, 787) Things that would normally take years to accomplish in the real world could be completed in virtual worlds in a matter of seconds by simply changing some of the game’s code. Sometimes doing so can lead to consequences which could be foreseen by real world economic principles. For example, when developers make the productivity of all players increase, marginal productivity of many items falls which leads to a reduction of wealth for the players. (Castronova, Policy Questions, 788) With this example the concept of game developers as policy makers for their virtual worlds has been introduced and will be discussed in more depth later on.

			One area which comes up often and is interesting to analyse and point out is the current role of governing bodies in the real world as opposed to the virtual world. Currently virtual worlds themselves have not had interference from real world governments even though on close analysis these two realms may not be as different as one may imagine. “Virtual economic transactions are economic transactions. There is no difference between trading a magic wand for a gold piece and trading legal services for a McDonald’s gift card, yet the latter would be taxed as a barter exchange while the former would not.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 790) There is seemingly no difference between items that are exchanged in the real world versus items that are exchanged in virtual worlds. Both these items contain value and are scarce. Chambers also states that “there is a lack of real world regulation such as price control, taxable assets and income control which would have a benefit for the real world and causes disadvantages to the virtual world. What must be considered is the legal position of the virtual world. For the virtual is not as virtual as its name suggests and is considered here as a continuum of the real world and thus must be subject to the Rule of Law.” (384) These statement are true when speaking about how virtual economies are continuations of the real world; however, involvement of the government in virtual economies should be more closely examined and questioned before becoming more widely accepted as the norm. One of the major differences that virtual worlds and real worlds have regarding the legitimacy of government action in virtual worlds is the ability to opt-out of a virtual world compared to the real world. “participation in these in-game economies is ultimately a choice, more akin to playing the stock market than to buying groceries. While players exchange their time or money for in-game goods and services, they can just as easily invest their time and money in activities of other sorts, effectively going ‘off the grid’ in a way rarely possible in real life. Unlike participation in the economy of the real world, the choice to participate in a virtual world is entirely voluntary.” (Thorpe, 2) Even if we do say as Castronova does, that games are no longer just for play, but provide people with employment and a ways to make a living, the option to opt-out of virtual worlds is still much more realistic and common than the ability to opt-out of the real world economy. In addition to this, no matter how you view the role of governments in the real world, the stated goals of real world governments and virtual world governments are different. Castronova himself states that “while policy-makers in the real world are (one hopes) motivated to promote welfare, the managers of a virtual economy are agents of a profit-maximizing firm. Thus the choice of economic policy that is ideal from the manager's perspective may not be the one that is ideal for the users’ welfare.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 794) An example of a rule that would be present in a video game world that could easily be avoided to benefit user welfare is the existence of piracy in the world of EVE Online. Piracy in the real world would clearly be illegal; however, even though developers have the ability to make piracy impossible by altering the code, they choose not to. Piracy is one of the ways to obtain ISK (EVE Online’s virtual currency). After discussing a situation in which one EVE Online player created a bank and then cashed out the money into real world dollars Scarle states that “if only considered within the VE it could be argued that such profiteering is not unethical or illegal, but it is just the perpetrator playing the role of a space pirate. It is then only at the point that this virtual currency was converted to real world currency, that these ethical and legal questions can be raised.” (398) Castranova states that “Right now the major concern is tracking the income generated by players who cash out of the system, but at some point, the internal transactions of the virtual economy… will have to enter the system of national economic accounts.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 790) Based on these sources, the point at which this scheme would be illegal is not when the player cashes out for real world currency, but at the point he stole ingame. This is because he has already stolen an item with real world value. By extension acts such as piracy and other illegal activities included by the developers may have to be banned even if they were allowed by design. This is because they are an example of real theft. As I stated previously, it is important to consider the option of players to opt-out of playing these games entirely. If the player realizes that piracy is part of the game’s design, it may even be one of the reasons he is intrigued by this world in the first place. Policy implications have also started to question whether or not other aspects of real world regulations should be implemented. “If a player in a virtual world hires a child to perform a task for her in that virtual world, and then compensates the child with virtual currency, is that transaction subject to child labor laws? Do minimum wage laws apply?” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 791) When approaching the question of whether third party regulations should be implemented in games it is important to recognize the implications of such regulations.

    				<p style="color: black;">
            Another difference between real world and virtual worlds is the way in which testing can be conducted. In the real world testing is either very difficult or impossible. When a law is passed or changed in the real world it applies to everybody immediately. In virtual worlds there are more options for testing the consequences of economic and governmental decisions. Running a test server is one option that developers have to test these changes. “new rules are given a test drive before they are distributed to the entire player base. Current players are given the opportunity to join the server and are invited to give their feedback on the changes.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 793) Real world government’s rules apply to everybody at the same time but this is not necessarily true for virtual worlds. It is possible, for example, to have different servers for the same game all with different rules. Not only are there more possibilities to test, the amount of time it would take to test all different possibilities is extremely shorter. “Changes that would be impossible, or at least generations-long, in the real world, can be implemented in virtual environments in a matter of months or years.” (Thorpe, 5) Changes that would literally be impossible in the real world because of our inability to change laws of nature, are not only possible but can be implemented relatively quickly in virtual worlds.

            Information is much more accessible, extensive and accurate in the real world than in virtual worlds. As opposed to the real world which relies on data collection methods such as the census, virtual worlds allow you to collect exact metrics in real time. “These people’s actions, economists say, offer a treasure trove of information to study and analyze, primarily because each one of their decisions leaves a trail, creating a vast database that economists can only dream of in the real world.” (Casey) This kind of information collection is unheard of in the real world but happens every day in virtual worlds. The collection of this information in the real world is “technically impossible” (Castronova, As Real as Real?, 689). This kind of information can also be helpful for the real world since economic concepts in virtual worlds apply to both worlds. (Casey) Macroeconomic concepts of real and virtual economies will be discussed in more detail later on.

    				<p style="color: black;">
            While governments in the virtual and real world may currently be two separate entities, there are still some similarities between the two. One way in which the two may act similarly is the way in which they asses community feedback. In virtual worlds, although votes are not common, forums allow users to speak to the developers and to other users with similar interests or complaints. (Castronova, Policy Questions, 792) Although this is not exactly the same as the way a government in the real world would operate, it is similar. In the real world you may have citizens vote on certain issues that concern them. In virtual world users may draw attention to certain aspects of the world in a forum. This feedback then leads to decision-making on behalf of the developers who respond to concerns or requests by the users. (Castronova, Policy Questions, 792) Another similarity between real and virtual worlds are their institutions. For example “real-world policy analysts may be quite comfortable assessing the rules of a game's virtual economy using the same tools that they would use to assess such agencies as the European Central Bank or the US Department of Commerce.” (Castronova, Policy Questions, 793) The same tools of analysis can be used for both real and virtual worlds. Agencies which regulate real world economies have the same sort of functions that virtual world developers have.

    				<p style="color: black;">
            Another constant in both virtual and real worlds are the people who populate them. As such you would expect to see human behavior stay constant between these two worlds. Studies such as Truck, barter and exchange versus the endowment effect: Virtual field experiments in an online game environment concludes that when dealing with the endowment effect, economic psychology remains constant in both realms. “The player to player trading market is very close to a real world market and shares the same basic microeconomic fundamentals of demand and supply.” (Thorpe)


    				</p>
    				<br>

            <p style="color: black;">
            Macroeconomic principles and behaviors has also been analysed in virtual worlds and compared to real worlds. Hyperinflation seems to be one of the biggest problems in virtual worlds  and has been analyzed in multiple studies. (Earle) One such analysis found that the hyperinflation which occurred in the game Diablo 3 and the money supply were closely linked to each other. “as in real world economies, the price effects of money inflation often arise unevenly. With gold prices falling, prices began spiking in certain goods.” (Earle) These worlds provide an interesting and new way of analysing macroeconomic concepts, their causes, and their effects. More generally, another study found that the economy of virtual worlds in general functions in a largely similar way to that of the real world. “aggregate economic behavior in EQ2 follows what one would expect to see in the real world.” (Castronova, As Real as Real?, 701)


    				</p>
    				<br>

            <p style="color: black;">
            Another way to compare virtual and real world would be in  a micro-economical sense. Drake-Bridges study of students using Second Life to apply their skills of wholesale and retail shows one way in which virtual worlds are powerful tools to interpret microeconomic behaviour. (Drake-Bridges) This study also demonstrates the potential for virtual economies to be used as a teaching tool. 


            </p>
            <br>

            <p style="color: black;">
            In conclusion virtual world and real world economies function more similarly than their names may suggest and may even be the same. Many of the differences between these two realms comes from the ability to manipulate and gather information from virtual worlds in ways that would be impossible in the real world. Virtual worlds give us the opportunity to examine how an economy can operate with a complexity that matches that of the real world. (Drake-Bridges) Another major difference from real worlds to virtual worlds is that of the role of government. Currently real world governments are not present in virtual worlds. Many articles on the subject would suggest that this may change sooner rather than later; however, more should be said and analysed before accepting real world governmental authority in virtual worlds. Despite these differences, the function of real world and virtual world economies remains largely similar in both a macro and micro sense. This can be seen by the way hyperinflation has affected virtual world economies due to an increase in the money supply. There are still many more research opportunities that have not been explored yet and as virtual economies increase in popularity, there will most likely be more interest in them from the mainstream.
